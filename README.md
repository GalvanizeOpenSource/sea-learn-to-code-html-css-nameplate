## Setting up your computer

(Brace yourself...)

#### Please set up the following:

* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: [chrome.google.com](http://chrome.google.com))
* A text editor to modify your files (Recommend the Atom text editor: [Atom.io](http://atom.io))

#### Download the files for this class:

1. Your instructor will point you to our repository for today.
2. Click on the button on the right-hand side that says "Download ZIP"
3. Go to your downloads folder and double click on the .zip file to unzip it
4. IMPORTANT! Leave all the individual files in the downloaded folder (if you would like to move it out of the downloads folder move the entire folder, not individual items)
5. From Atom: File > open, select the folder and then click "Open"
6. From Atom: If the file tree does not appear on the left hand View > Toggle Tree View -- this will show you the entire folder within Atom (or `Cmd + \` on OSX )
7. Feel free to poke around in the files (`index.html` and `style.css` are the two files we will be using.)
8. Open `index.html` in your browser. (In chrome select: "File" > "Open File..." > find the downloaded project folder and select `index.html` )

Patience! Setting up your computer takes time and can be tricky, especially across platforms.

Once you're ready, you can move onto the next lesson.

## HTML - "the building blocks of the internet"

Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML, is the most elemental language of the internet. Everything you see within your web browser is an interpretation of HTML in some form of other, and it is essential to learn in all web development.

###### HTML is made up of blocks called *elements*

Each element has 3 pieces:

* `Content` - the text you want visible on the page
* `<Tag>` - code that wraps around the content of an element to designate a particular effect, sometimes inherent to the tag.
* `Attributes="value"` - optional extra information about an element that is not displayed on the page.

Example:

```
<p id='p1'>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

#### HTML Tags:

Tags are used to mark up the beginning and end of an HTML element.

Almost everything in HTML needs to start and end with a tag. In between the opening and closing tags you can put text content or even other tags!

- like this: `<div>Hello!</div>`
- or even this: `<div> <p>paragraph text</p> </div>`
- *Note: not every element has a closing tag!*

###### Common Tags:

- `<html></html>` designates document as HTML
- `<div></div>` notes a block element in the page
- `<a></a>` anchor, activates a link in the page
- `<head></head>` contains meta information
- `<body></body>` contains browser information
- `<h1></h1>` notes a heading of the largest size
- [There are many more elements!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

###### Irregular Tags:

- `<img />` creates an image in the page
- `<br />` creates a line break in the page
- `<hr />` creates a horizontal line
- `<link />` connects html to related documents (usually stylesheets)
- `<input />` creates an input field

#### HTML Attributes:

HTML attributes contain extra information about the element which you don't want to appear in the actual content.

Attributes are generally defined as name-value pairs:

![](./assets/attribute.png)

More detailed info can be found on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#Attributes)

###### The most common attributes are:

- `id=""` - used to identify an element (The same id can only be used once)
- `class=""` - Sets the CSS class/s of an element. The same class can be used on multiple elements.
- `href=""` - hyperlink reference to an internal or external link
- `src=""` - source file to an image, video, etc.
- `style=""` - add some color, font, margins, etc.
- ^ *There‚Äôs a MUCH better way to do this via CSS - more on that later!*

How do we check whether elements are showing up in the browser? Use the **inspect element** feature!

## LET'S CODE!

###### Remember:

- Coding can be hard - be patient!
- Work in pairs! Even the pros do it
- Ask for help - we‚Äôre in a school!

#### Let's get started!

1. Open up your text editor
2. Navigate to the folder
3. Open up the following files:
  * `index.html`
  * `custom.css`, inside the `styles/` folder

### Challenge

- Add an `<h1>` tag to your page with your name
- Add a `<p>` tag underneath your name with your city and state
- Add another `<p>` tag underneath your name with your birthday
- Change the `<title>` to something that makes sense for your page

## Overview of CSS

What Does CSS Stand for?

- Cascading - prioritizing certain values over others
- Style - focusing on layout, colors, fonts, etc.
- Sheet - another name for the file we use here

The internet used to be ugly. Enter CSS - a consolidated way to make it prettier.

CSS looks like this:

![](./assets/css-rule.jpg)

The three main parts include:

* `selector` - tells CSS which element to style using html tag, id or class.
* `property` - which style property to change
* `value` - the result value to use for the chosen property

#### CSS Selectors:

- Tag: effects all h1, div, body, a elements on the page
	- `div {...}`
- IDs: effects the element with corresponding ID
	- `#myId {...}`
- Classes: effects all elements with the specified class
	- `.className {...}`

Example CSS Code:

```
h1 {  // this is either an element, class, or ID
	font-size: 24px; // syntax is name: value;
	font-weight: bold;
	color: #000000; // hexadecimal, RGB, etc.
}
```

#### What are IDs?
IDs are attributes that are used only on one element ONLY and noted with a ‚Äú#‚Äù symbol in CSS
e.g.

**HTML:**

```html
<p id="green-hero">Hal Jordan</p>
```

**CSS:**

```css
#green-hero {
  color: green;
}
```
IDs are also used to direct locate unique elements in the HTML so that there‚Äôs no confusion

*e.g clicking to a specific part of page*

#### What are Classes?

Classes are attributes assigned to multiple elements on a page noted with a ‚Äú.‚Äù symbol in CSS.

**HTML:**

```html
<p class="green-hero">Hal Jordan</p>
<p class="green-hero">Bruce Banner</p>
<p class="green-hero">Oliver Queen</p>
```

**CSS:**

```css
.green-hero {
  color: green;
}
```

Classes are used to change or affect multiple items in an HTML document at once.

*e.g. everything with class="green-hero" should have the same attributes*

In tandem, you can do a lot with HTML & CSS! Let's give it a shot!

## LET'S CODE!

###### Remember:

- Coding can be hard - be patient!
- Work in pairs! Even the pros do it
- Ask for help - we‚Äôre in a school!

#### Let's get started!

1. Open up your text editor
2. Navigate to the folder
3. Open up the following files:
  * `index.html`
  * `custom.css`, inside the `styles/` folder

#### Challenge

- Add color to the elements with class `section`
- Try adding CSS rules like: `border`, `background`, `font-size`, `text-align`

#### Let's change the font!

1. Navigate to [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
2. Find a font you like and click "Add to Collection"
3. On the bottom right side of your screen click the small window that just popped up
4. Find the `link` element and copy that entire line
5. Paste that link tag in your `index.html` file above your `custom.css` but below the `main.css`
6. Copy the CSS rule you see
7. Add or modify a rule where you select just an `h1` tag with the CSS rule you just copied
8. Save and refresh the page!

Did it work! Great! If not open up **Inspect Element** and see what happened.

## Play around in the sandbox!

Try one of the following:

- Change the name of the site to... whatever!
- Wrap your content with more `<div>`s and style it up
- Add images and GIFs from online
- Embed a video from YouTube!
